Osteosarcoma data from UT Southwestern/UT Dallas for Viable and Necrotic Tumor Assessment
Retrieved from: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52756935#52756935bcab02c187174a288dbcbf95d26179e8

Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer that occurs in adolescents in the age of 10 to 14 years.
The dataset is composed of Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained osteosarcoma histology images.
The data was collected by a team of clinical scientists at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.
Archival samples for 50 patients treated at Childrenâ€™ s Medical Center, Dallas, between 1995 and 2015, were used to
create this dataset. Four patients (out of 50) were selected by pathologists based on diversity of tumor specimens
after surgical resection. The images are labelled as Non-Tumor, Viable Tumor and Necrosis according to the predominant
cancer type in each image. The annotation was performed by two medical experts. All images were divided between two
pathologists for the annotation activity. Each image had a single annotation as any given image was annotated by only
one pathologist. The dataset consists of 1144 images of size 1024 X 1024 at 10X resolution with the following
distribution: 536 (47%) non-tumor images, 263 (23%) necrotic tumor images and 345 (30%) viable tumor tiles.
